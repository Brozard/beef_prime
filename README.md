# Beef Prime
Coding challenge response for a job application, or "Man, I should've called this 'Prime Beef'"

I recently applied for a job at a development agency in South Florida. Instead of sending coding challenges to applicants, they required them to complete one as part of the application.

The exact challenge was to "Write a program that prints the 444th prime number whose hexadecimal representation contains 'BEEF'." Since Ruby uses lowercase letters for hex values, I changed this to 'beef', but I intend to write another version that will accept any text value.
